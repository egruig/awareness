when you resist an emotion, emotion amplifies

your emotions are your teachers

RESENTMENT shows you where you lack boundaries
JEALOUSY shows you what you most desire
SHAME teaches you what parts of you need acceptance
FEAR shows you your biggest opportunities for growth
ANXIETY teaches you where you need to ground in the present
ANGER teaches you where you want justice
SADNESS teaches you how to let go

every emotional state exists for a very specific purpose
but when you avoid feeling, you also avoid healing
let your emotions guide you to a deeper understanding of your inner truth
