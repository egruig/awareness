spiritual gurus teach you to meet your own needs (as opposed to getting your needs met by others) as if it is a moral or better or more righteous thing to do

when the real solution is to practice whichever one causes you empowerment

neither is right or wrong

because we are all one, having our needs met from others is having our needs met by ourselves
