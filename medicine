don't fail to recognize "your medicine"
and be generous with it

a person's medicine could come in the form of:
- INFORMATION
- a SKILL they have
- a PERSPECTIVE they hold
- a SERVICE they can provide
- a TALENT they possess
- the presence of their ENERGY

someone else needs "your medicine" when you are a necessary part of someone else's transformation and renewal
