shame is not a joke

shame is a bilogical affective reaction

but it's the emotional byproduct of the biological affective reaction (shame) that's creating a split within your own consciousness because you're pushing a part of yourself away to try to gain rapport with the person who disapproved of it in the first place

that's shame

shame is not an emotion

it's just like the fight or flight mode

it is the mechanism that fragments the psyche
