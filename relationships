regardless of how hard relationships can be at times, I would advise people to take risks in the name of love and never regret it

no matter what a relationship turns into, love is never a bad idea

love may very well be unconditional, but I assure you that relationships are not

to withdraw in a relationship is to commit emotional divorce, and the nr 1 symptom of withdrawal is lack of communication
